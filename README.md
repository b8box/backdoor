HTTP command line backdoor using scala & play-2.1
-----------------------------------------------

When:

- a server needs attention
- I'm travelling
- there is no wifi available
- but only a windows machine in a cyber

Then I use that HTTP backdoor to emulate a SSH connection to my server.

The application is entirely unsecured. I use nginx basic HTTP auth to restrict access.
Use at your own risks.
